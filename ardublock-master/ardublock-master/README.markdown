ArduBlock
======

ArduBlock is a Block Programming Language for Arduino. The language and functions model closely to [Arduino Language Reference](http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/HomePage)


Installation
----
The project is managed by Maven. After checking out the source for the first time, one should run the following to install Arduino's pde.jar into the local repository. 

	$ mvn validate
	
	$ mvn clean package

Usage
----

	$ mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.ardublock.Main"

Development
----
Change the /src/main/resources/com/ardublock/block/ardublock.xml to add new blocks to ArduBlock

	$ mvn clean package

	$ mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.ardublock.Main"

The Visual Block environment should show up. Happy Hacking! ;) 


Eclipse
---------
mvn eclipse:eclipse

Deploy
----
Edit code of ardublock

	$ mvn clean package

copy the target/ardublock-all.jar to Arduino\tools\ArduBlockTool\tool

ToDo
----
* Integrate the [scripting engine](http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/J2SE/Desktop/scripting/) into the language blocks for code generation
